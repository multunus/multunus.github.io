<p>This article was originally written by me for <a href="http://yourstory.in/2011/12/a-sneak-peek-into-mobile-app-opportunities-in-2012/">yourstory.in</a>. But this version is more “complete” with all of the original links in place.</p>

<p>This was originally supposed to be a post on predictions. But as the founder of a mobile app development company myself, my focus is more on specific opportunities that exist for a boutique company such as ourselves in this space.</p>

<p>We all know that almost no opportunity is exactly what it seems like, but it pays to have good starting points of exploration. And that is what I hope you will leave with, after reading this article.</p>

<h2 id="first-lets-look-at-somefacts">First let’s look at some facts</h2>

<ul>
  <li>About 40 per cent of Internet users in India 
<a href="http://www.medianama.com/2011/03/223-google-india-has-100m-internet-40m-mobile-internet-users-india-search-trends/">access it on their mobile phones</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://googlemobileads.blogspot.com/2011/06/mobile-ize-your-business-with-google.html">61% users are unlikely</a> to return to a site that they found were not mobile optimized. What’s worse, 40% of them are likely to go to a competitor’s website.</li>
  <li>The middle class in the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) countries together have the  
<a href="http://blog.flurry.com/bid/79595/Kaboom-iOS-and-Android-International-Installed-Base-Expansion">largest untapped populations</a> that can now afford a smart phone but are yet to get one.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="now-take-a-look-at-some-majortrends">Now take a look at some major trends</h2>

<h3 id="more-platforms">More Platforms</h3>
<p>We have Apple to thank - for creating the app economy with the iOS platform, Google for democratizing the smart phone with Android and
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/12/28/windows-phone-marketplace-hits-50-000-app-submission-milestone/">now Microsoft</a> for making the life of the “I support all platforms” developer more difficult with Windows Phone 7. If you still want to include Blackberry, despite all of the
<a href="http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/wall-street-journal/pressure-mounts-on-blackberrys-rim/story-fnay3ubk-1226223581617">recent gloom</a>, then that would make it 4 platforms that you’d at least want to consider.</p>

<p>There are now more a million active apps now available across the major app stores. Apple’s app store and the Android Market currently lead by a large margin. However 2012 will probably bring in at least one more serious contender in the Windows Phone 7 marketplace - it has grown by more than 400% this year alone.</p>

<p>The following chart shows the distribution of apps across various marketplaces as of Nov 2011 [Sources:

<h3 id="mobile-optimization-services">Mobile Optimization Services</h3>
<p>There are now multiple services available that make it easy for small business owners to “mobili”-ze their websites. Here are 3 such services:

<h3 id="html5-mobile">HTML5 Mobile</h3>

And with the Flash war finally having  ended, Adobe is finally <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/11/11/flash-mobile-dead-adobe/">getting on board</a> as well.</p>

<p><strong>*Cross Platform Tools: </strong>
These tools make it possible for the app developer to write-once-and-run-on-multiple-platforms. Or at least they try to make that possible.

<h3 id="cross-device-testing-as-a-service">Cross Device Testing as a Service</h3>
<p>With more than 300 Android handsets now available from various manufacturers, it is next to impossible to manually test an application across all these devices. There are now <a href="http://testdroid.com/">multiple</a> [services](http://www.perfectomobile.com/portal/cms/android.html on the cloud that aim to solve this problem for you by automatically testing your Android applications across a wide array of devices.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-above-in-mind-here-are-a-fewopportunitiesfor-2012">Keeping the above in mind, here are a few opportunities for 2012</h2>

<h3 id="hybrid-cross-platform-apps">“Hybrid” Cross Platform Apps</h3>
<p>The cross platform tools I’ve referred to above, allow for native platform API [Application Programming Interface] calls as well. These are useful when you have an application that has a combination of native components and other “content” components which most likely consume web services [and can be built with HTML5 and CSS3].</p>

<p>An example of such an application is the 
<a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/01/the-onion-releases-free-html5-ipad-app/">Onion iPad</a> app. The application is written in HTML5 for the most part - but uses falls back on native API to play video. This is probably because of 
<a href="http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2011/03/html5-video-issues-on-the-ipad-and-how-to-solve-them/">some of the issues</a> related to HTML5 video tag support on iOS. The Onion plans to roll out the app quickly on the Android platform as well - and 
<a href="http://sndstl.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/snd-app.pdf">with mostly the same code</a> [pdf].</p>

<p>Main Challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Cross Platform Tools are not mature yet:</strong> - The API documentation is sparse, support is patchy and the community is still nascent. So which platform should you bet on? Unfortunately, the answer is, “it depends” - on multiple factors such as whether you need a native look and feel (which Appcelerator and Rhodes provide - but PhoneGap does not), the number of platforms you need to support, the technical skills of your dev team etc.</li>
  <li><strong>The Mobile Web is Slow(er):</strong> - Performance optimization is key if you want your site to look pretty and be snappy on mobile devices. There are <a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?q=html5+performance+mobile">many good resources</a> available to get you started in the right direction.
 
### Low Cost Solutions for Mobile Optimization
While purely content based sites can choose to rely on the Mobile Optimization Services I’ve mentioned above, there are a lot of other verticals that don’t have such an option - yet. For example, there are a lot of E-Commerce sites out there that are not mobile optimized. Especially those being run by small business owners or startups.</li>
</ul>

<p>Main Challenges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data has to kept in sync with the original systems - in a seamless fashion</li>
  <li>Mobile payment gateways are still far from mature - 
<a href="http://www.venturewoods.org/index.php/2011/01/19/mobile-payments-shifting-opportunities-for-startups/">especially in a country like India</a>.</li>
  <li>Oh, and the Mobile Web is Slow - but I said that already.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="mobile-presence-for-non-internet-savvy-retailers">Mobile presence for non-Internet-Savvy retailers</h3>
<p>I’m going on a limb here - but most small retailers in India don’t have an Internet presence - and what that means is, a certain  high quality trouser shop with very reasonable price tags - is now invisible on your phone.</p>

<p>Main Challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>With even companies like Google
<a href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-06-20/internet/29679379_1_google-street-view-google-s-street-view-privacy-concerns">facing stiff resistance</a> while trying to map our streets, you’re left with the only other option - User Generated Content. And that in turn means, the classic chicken and egg conundrum.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cross-platform-testing-as-service">Cross Platform Testing as Service</h3>
<p>While there are cloud testing services now available for specific platforms, services that take care of automated cross-platform testing are still not available.</p>

<p>Main Challenge:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’ve got SDK installations, developer &amp; signing certificates, build chains, and custom project layouts to worry about with each platform. <a href="http://savagelook.com/blog/portfolio/8-things-to-know-about-phonegap">PhoneGap solves this problem</a> for you from a deployment perspective, but running automated tests on multiple platforms is a different challenge.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list of opportunities is admittedly short. But I hope you are now motivated to brainstorm more ideas, distill the most interesting opportunities and finally implement a winner in 2012. Happy New Year!</p>
