Why is delivering good software on a consistent basis hard? There are many existing answers to this question already. This is our version.

A list of things good software should achieve:* Should solve a real problem

	
* Should be shipped and maintained within the budgeted cost and time

	
* Should be easy to use

**Update: **
We’ve now migrated to 
[James Shore’s definition](http://jamesshore.com/Agile-Book/why_agile.html):


“Success is usually defined as delivering on time, under budget, and as specified. That’s a flawed definition. Many late projects are huge successes for their organizations, and many on-time projects don’t deliver any value. Instead, think in terms of organizational, technical, and personal success.”

What it takes to build such software:

***Great code**
: Easily Testable, Maintainable & Scalable code across ALL Tiers of the App

	
***Constant estimating and planning**
: Has to be woven into the Iterative Release process

	
***Feedback Management**
: Collection & Processing of Qualitative & Quantitative Feedback

	
***Continuous Improvement**
: A team habit of proactively finding and fixing problems

	
***Good Infrastructure**
: S/W & H/W tools to improve Team & Apps efficiency

	
***High Quality**
: Focus on all

***Constant Communication**
: Customer Collaboration & Team Interaction along with just enough Documentation

	
***Great Design**
: Balancing Form with Function

	
***Constant UX Focus**
: Focus on the user’s interactive experience [along with focus on Copy] woven into the Iterative Release Process. This is covered by Quadrant 3 in the Agile Testing diagram linked to above - but I’m mentioning it separately because its usually happens to get less attention.

	
***Knowledgeable, Skilled and Motivated Team**
: Important roles include Managers, Programmers, Testers, Analysts, Leads, Architects and Designers
