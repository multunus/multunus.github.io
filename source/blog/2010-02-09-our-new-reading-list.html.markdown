As mentioned in an 
[earlier post](http://www.multunus.com/2010/01/our-pragmatic-processes/), our team shares what they learn on a daily basis in our morning stand-ups. Considering our primary focus as a company is lean product development, we felt we could be more aligned with our goals if each of us read books [or blogs] on related subjects. Here’s the current list that we’ve come up with.* [Web Analytics An Hour A Day](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Analytics-Hour-Avinash-Kaushik/dp/0470130652)

    
* [Rocket Surgery Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/Rocket-Surgery-Made-Easy-Yourself/dp/0321657292)

    
* [The Art of Lean Software Development](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Lean-Software-Development-Incremental/dp/0596517319)

    
* [StartUpLessonsLearned.com](http://startuplessonslearned.com/)

    
* [Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959)

    
* [Don’t make me think](http://www.amazon.com/Think-Common-Sense-Approach-Usability/dp/0789723107)

    
* [User Stories Applied](http://www.amazon.com/User-Stories-Applied-Software-Development/dp/0321205685)
